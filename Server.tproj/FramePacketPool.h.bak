    File:       FramePacketPool.h

    Contains:   PacketPool class to buffer and track re-transmits of RTP packets.
    
    the ctor copies the packet data, sets a timer for the packet's age limit and
    another timer for it's possible re-transmission.
    A duration timer is started to measure the RTT based on the client's ack.
